TASKS:
a) Download the dataset from Kaggle, google (community based discussion dataset Ã  train the model through twitter dataset)
b) Auto-analysis of sentiment of the users through their comments (Positive, Negative & Neutral)
c) Plot a graph based on the output Vs timeline (15 days, 1 month, 3 months)
d) Further, enhance the accuracy of predicting the sentiment through neural network model



In first try I used a pretrained model in NLP that is BERT MODEL,I improved the accuracy of the model using another NLP implementatiion.I have used two kind of datasets and both were taken from Kaggle.
